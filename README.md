# Gen-AI: Retrieval Augmented Generation

Gen-AI is a Generative AI framework used in natural language processing. It combines two techniques:

1. **Retrieval-based method:** Retrieving relevant information from a large collection of documents or knowledge resources.
2. **Generation-based method:** Generating a response based on the retrieved information and an input.

By combining these techniques, Gen-AI generates text that is more accurate, relevant, and informative.

### Application of RAG

RAG is useful for tasks requiring a combination of factual awareness and generative capabilities, such as:
- Conversational agents
- Question answering systems

### How it works

- **Retrieval-based models** are trained using huge datasets to retrieve relevant data when presented with a query.
- **Generative models** can generate new text content (e.g., LLM models).

### Example:

**Query:** "Capital of France"
- **Retrieval:** "Paris is the capital of France"
- **Generation:** "Paris"

The ability to retrieve relevant information enhances the accuracy of generation.

RAG is an emerging technology in Generative AI. For example, Google search uses RAG techniques.
